# AkBot

This is the public and now main repository for AkBot, a Discord bot used by the esport association ESEV Zephyr. Currently, this bot is used to maintain points that can be won through attending events organized by ESEV Zephyr and playing a multiplayer version of Wordle. The bot also has a reservation system in place where users can reserve time slots for the PCs available on location.

## Requirements:
+ Node.js (version 18.12.1)
+ Discord.js (version 14.7.1)
+ All packages are inside package.json and can be installed through npm or any other package manager. (npm install)

This discord bot makes use of a .env file with all of the secret tokens and keys. This file can be obtained by contacting a board member of ESEV Zephyr. 
Once obtained, paste the .env file inside the main directory of AkBot.
